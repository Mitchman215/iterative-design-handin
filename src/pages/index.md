### Critique

## 2nd Lofi Iteration
The feedback we received from our peers included suggetsions regarding general formatting of our sketches and specific technical choices for ease of interpretation by the end users. Some suggestions included not having too much whitespace in our initial log-in/sing up screen in order to differentiate between the figma background and the frame background, making sure to include the scrollable history on all screens, and having consistent formatting across all the screens. Some thought the setup part might be confusing, especially for new developers, and suggestions included perhaps having a prompt before starting the technicals. One suggestion was to include some sort of progress indication regarding the length of the marketing survey and perhaps the entire onboarding experience. In addition, the "Other" option in the marketing survey with the included text box below it seemed confusing to some. Some points to consider were how multi-select would work within the clicking process, since a variable amount of options may be desired. Additional suggestions included having screens to introduce/transition between different parts of the first-time user experience (e.g. survey --> onboarding --> walkthrough), changing the name of the marketing survey to "intro survey" instead, and including a side panel that allows for between navigation and skipping through the onboarding experience.
